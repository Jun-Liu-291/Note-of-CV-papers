## Intro:
  Obtain way more better accurayc with 12 times fewer parameters than the winning architecture of Krizhevsky (U of T) in 2012.<br>
  A lot progress in image recognition and object detection is not just from more powerful hardware, larger dataset or bigger models, but from new ideas, algorithms, new architectures and classical computer vision.<br>
