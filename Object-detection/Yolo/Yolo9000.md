# YOLO9000

## 1. Introduction
  * General purpose object detection shoudld be fast, accurate, and agble to recognize a wide variety of objects.
  * Current object detection datasets are limited compared to datasets for other tasks like classification and tagging.
  * use a hieraichical view of obejct classification that allows us to combine distinct datasets together
  * propose a joint training algorithm that allows us to train object detectors on both detection and classification data.
## 2. Better
  * __Batch Normalization__
