# YOLO9000

## 1. Introduction
  * General purpose object detection shoudld be fast, accurate, and agble to recognize a wide variety of objects.
  * Current object detection datasets are limited compared to datasets for other tasks like classification and tagging.
  * use a hieraichical view of obejct classification that allows us to combine distinct datasets together
  * propose a joint training algorithm that allows us to train object detectors on both detection and classification data.
## 2. Better
  * __Batch Normalization__: with batch normalization we can remove dropout from the model without overfitting.
  * __High Resolution Classifier__: original YOLO pretrained on 224 * 224 and increases the resolution to 448 * 448 for detection; YOLOv2 first fine tune the classification network at the full 448 * 448 resolution for 10 epochs on ImageNet. which gives the network time to adjust its filters to work better on higher resolution input.
  * __Convolutional With Anchor Boxes__:  remove the fully connected layers from YOLO and use anchor boxes to predict boundinng boxes. First, eliminate one pooling layer to make the output of the network's conv layers higher resolution, and also shrink the network to operate on 416 input images, so that an odd number of locations in our feature map so there is an single center cell. downsampled the image by a factor of 32 so by using an input image of 416 we get an output feature map of 13 * 13.
  * __Dimension Clusters__: Encounter two issues with anchor boxes when using them with YOLO</br>
   * 1. box dimensions are hand picked
