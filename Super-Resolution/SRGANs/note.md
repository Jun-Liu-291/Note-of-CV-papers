## Abstract:

  * One central problem remain: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors?
  * The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function (mean squared reconstruction error).
  * To achieve 4 times upscaling photo-realistic natural images, they propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss.
    * the adversarial loss
